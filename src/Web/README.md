## API Integration

The website connects to the MeetupPlanner API to fetch:
- Meetups (upcoming and past)
- Speakers
- Locations
- Presentations

API client is located at `src/lib/api/client.ts` and provides typed methods for all endpoints.

## Styling

The design matches the original screenshot with:
- Clean, minimal layout
- Handwritten-style headings using Caveat font
- Black borders for event cards
- Responsive grid layout
- Typography optimized for readability

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
